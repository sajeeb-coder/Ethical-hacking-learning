Offensive Security Intro (TryHackMe)

This room introduced me to the fundamentals of Offensive
 Security, which focuses on thinking like an attacker in
 order to identify weaknesses in systems before real
 attackers can exploit them. The goal of offensive security
 is not to cause harm, but to help organizations strengthen
 their defenses by proactively finding vulnerabilities.

A realistic banking account scenario was used to demonstrate
 how attackers may target sensitive systems such as online
 banking platforms. This helped me understand why financial
 applications are high‑value targets and why strong security
 testing is critical in such environments.

Tools & Concepts Covered in This Room

Although this room is introductory and does not focus on
 advanced exploitation, it introduces important tools and
 concepts used in offensive security:

Simulated Web Application (Bank Portal)
Used to demonstrate how attackers analyze web-based systems
 and user accounts.

Directory & Link Enumeration (DIRB concept)
Introduced the idea of discovering hidden directories and
 links on a web server, which attackers use to find exposed
 or unprotected resources.

Authentication & Account Access Concepts
Explained how login mechanisms work and why weak
 authentication can lead to account compromise.

Attacker Mindset
Focused on how an attacker thinks, selects targets, and looks
 for entry points rather than immediately using tools.

Offensive Security Methodology (Intro Level)
Basic understanding of reconnaissance and initial discovery 
phases of an attack.

Ethical and Legal Boundaries
Emphasized that all security testing must be done legally,
 ethically, and only with proper authorization.

What I Learned

The difference between Ethical Hacking and Illegal Hacking

What Offensive Security means and why it is important

Why banking and financial systems are common attack targets

The importance of reconnaissance and directory discovery

The need to follow legal and ethical guidelines in cybersecurity

This room provided a strong foundation for my ethical hacking
 journey and prepared me to move forward with more technical
 topics such as Linux, networking, scanning, and web exploitation.
